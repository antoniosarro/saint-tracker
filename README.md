**Saint Tracker** is an open-source web application designed to track the real-time position of religious statues during processions or events, starting from the case of **Saint Anthony in Montefalcione (Italy)** and now easily extendable to any other saint or statue.

The project was born from the friendship and collaboration between **Antonio Sarro** and **Giovanni Rapa**, with the goal of creating something useful and meaningful for the local community.
